SON to Excel Converter

This script converts data from a JSON file to an Excel (.xlsx) file.

Requirements:

pandas
json
How to Use:

File Placement: Ensure the JSON file you want to convert is in the same directory as the script or provide the full path to the file.

File Names: Modify the file_json and file_excel variables to match the names of your JSON input file and desired Excel output file. For example:

Python

file_json = "my_data.json"
file_excel = "my_data.xlsx"
Run the Script:

Bash

python json_to_excel.py
Output:

The script creates an Excel file with the same name (but .xlsx extension) as the input JSON file. The data from the JSON file will be organized into a spreadsheet within the Excel file.

Error Handling:

The script assumes the JSON file is correctly formatted. If the JSON is invalid, the script will produce an error.
